            Currently, there is no built-in way to set a minimum purchase
            quantity for a specific product. However, to add a minimum or
            maximum order total, go to the Store Control Panel, click Settings,
            and then click Cart & Checkout. Set the minimum or maximum allowed
            order subtotal. If it is crucial to set a limit on a specific
            product, you can add the Purchase Quantity app in the Store Control
            Panel.
